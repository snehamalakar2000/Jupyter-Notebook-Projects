Infact, there is an increase in active gas wells significantly from 1975 which is contradictory to the purpose of the movement. We do see a decline in number of active oil wells from 1978 which might indicate more dependency on renewable sources. However, we end up having more number of active oil wells in 1999 than in 1967.
